Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature supports both guests and hosts, enabling role-based access and ensuring secure, personalized experiences across the platform.

2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with details like title, description, price, and images. It’s essential for populating the marketplace and allows guests to browse and book accommodations.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates, automatically calculating the total cost. This is the core transactional feature, ensuring users can reserve stays with hosts securely and efficiently.

4. Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay, which are displayed on property pages. This builds trust within the community and helps future guests make informed decisions.

5. Payment Integration
Handles secure payments for bookings using third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). This ensures the platform can process transactions smoothly and protect both hosts and guests financially.

6. Search and Filtering
Allows users to search for properties by location, date, price, and amenities. It enhances user experience by helping guests find listings that match their specific needs quickly.

7. Availability Management
Lets hosts block out unavailable dates and prevents double bookings. This ensures accurate scheduling and improves reliability for both hosts and guests.


API Security

1. Authentication (Login & Registration Security)
What: Use secure authentication mechanisms such as hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt) and token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
Why it's crucial: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can access personal or booking-related data.

2. Authorization (Role-Based Access Control)
What: Implement role-based permissions to restrict what actions users can perform (e.g., only hosts can manage properties, only guests can book).
Why it's crucial: Prevents unauthorized actions and protects sensitive or business-critical operations (e.g., a guest shouldn’t be able to delete someone else’s property).

3. Input Validation & Sanitization
What: Sanitize and validate all user inputs on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Why it's crucial: Prevents malicious inputs that could compromise the database or affect user sessions and interface integrity.

4. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
What: Limit repeated requests to sensitive endpoints (e.g., login) using tools like express-rate-limit.
Why it's crucial: Helps prevent brute force attacks and abuse of the API, enhancing platform performance and user safety.

5. HTTPS / TLS Encryption
What: Enforce HTTPS for all data transmission.
Why it's crucial: Ensures that sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) is encrypted during transit and not intercepted by third parties.

6. Secure Payment Processing
What: Use trusted third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and never store raw credit card data.
Why it's crucial: Protects financial information, ensures compliance with PCI standards, and builds trust with users.

7. Session Management & Token Expiry
What: Implement secure session tokens with expiration, and refresh tokens where applicable.
Why it's crucial: Prevents session hijacking and reduces the risk of unauthorized access from persistent tokens.

8. Error Handling & Logging
What: Log errors securely and avoid exposing stack traces or internal messages to users.
Why it's crucial: Helps detect and fix issues without leaking sensitive implementation details that attackers could exploit.


CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying your application whenever code changes are made.
Continuous Integration ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase.
Continuous Deployment (or Delivery) automates the deployment of changes to a staging or production environment once they pass tests.

Why CI/CD Is Important for This Project
Faster Development: Changes go live faster without manual steps.
Higher Quality: Automated testing reduces bugs and ensures stable deployments.
Consistency: Eliminates human error in building and deploying code.
Collaboration: Developers can safely contribute without breaking the project.

Tools You Can Use
GitHub Actions: Automate CI/CD directly within your GitHub repository.
Docker: Containerize your app for consistent deployment across environments.
Docker Compose: Manage multi-container setups like app + database.
Heroku / Vercel / AWS / DigitalOcean: For deploying the application.
Jest / Supertest: For automated backend testing.
ESLint / Prettier: For code formatting and linting during the CI process.
